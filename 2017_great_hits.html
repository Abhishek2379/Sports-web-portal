                <p class="deco">Parthiv Patel could not have scripted a better end to the 2016-17 Ranji Trophy. He first scored 90 to set up a lead and followed it with 143 to seal the highest successful chase in a final.</p>
                <p><b style="color:black">Patel: </b>Basically, it's because of a good plan back in Gujarat. Before the start of the season, we play a lot of practice matches. When we sit to pick the team, our meeting doesn't last more than four-five minutes because the players pick themselves on their performances. We play so many matches before the start of the season that we are ready to hit the ground running. The system for junior cricket is very good and those who perform in district cricket get an opportunity to play in the KSCA or Buchi Babu tournament. </p>

                <p class="deco">Nicky van der Bergh and Rassie van der Dussen were the overnight batsmen who were tasked with keeping the lethal quartet of Knights seamers in Duanne Olivier, Marchant de Lange, Shadley van Schalkwyk and Mbulelo Budaza at bay.</p>

                <h3 class="deco"><p><b>Mumbai Indians beat Rising Pune Supergiants to win their third title</b></p></h3>
                <p class="deco">The Mumbai Indians were on Sunday night crowned VIVO IPL 2017 Champions. In a match befitting of a tournament finale, MI won their third IPL title after they defeated Rising Pune Supergiant by a solitary run at the Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium in Hyderabad.
</p>
                <p class="deco">Despite an underwhelming performance with the bat, and a sloppy performance in the field, the MI bowlers applied the squeeze on their opponents, eventually leading their team to a 1-run win. After scoring a below-par 129-8, MI restricted RPS to 128-6.
</p>
                <p class="deco">For MI, the entire bowling group was excellent on the night and at no time let RPS get ahead of the game. Lasith Malinga, whoâ€™d had a largely forgettable tournament, bowled his best spell of the season; he got his yorkers right and executed the change of pace brilliantly. Bumrah and Johnson were outstanding at key moments in the match and shared the spoils. Mention should also be made of Karn Sharma, who only conceded 18 runs in his four-over spell.</p>
